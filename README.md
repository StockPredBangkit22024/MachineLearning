StockPred is a cutting-edge stock prediction tool that utilizes AI to predict stock prices based on macroeconomic factors. This repository includes the necessary assets and code for training the AI model.

## Built for Bangkit 2024 Batch 2 Capstone Project
This initiative is part of the capstone project for the Bangkit 2024 Batch 2 program.

## Features
- **[Dataset](Dataset)**: The repository contains datasets for 20 selected stocks, macroeconomic indicators (such as inflation rate, BI-Rate, and USDIDR exchange rate), and a combined dataset, which can be used to train the model.
- **[Google Colab Code](Google%20Colab%20Code)**: All necessary code for training the prediction model is included.
- **[Saved Model](Saved%20Model)**: The results from the training process are stored here.
- **[Training Results for Each Stock](Training%20Results%20for%20Each%20Stock)**: Detailed outcomes from training on each individual stock are available.

## Let's Get Started

To get started with the StockPred Machine Learning project, please follow these detailed steps:
